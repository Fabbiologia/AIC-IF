# Supplementary Material: The AI-Driven Citation Impact Factor Framework

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The AI-Driven Citation Impact Factor (AIC-IF) framework represents a novel approach to tracking, attributing, and crediting scientific contributions in an ecosystem increasingly mediated by artificial intelligence systems. Traditional citation metrics fail to capture how AI systems utilize scientific knowledge, creating significant gaps in attribution and credit distribution.

### Key Challenges Addressed
- **Attribution Gap**: Scientific contributions used by AI systems often remain uncredited
- **Equity Concerns**: Benefits of AI advancement may not flow back to original knowledge creators
- **Incentive Misalignment**: Scientific reward systems fail to recognize contributions to AI knowledge
- **Verification Challenges**: Claims made by AI systems lack clear provenance information

## 2. Framework Architecture

The AIC-IF framework consists of four interconnected layers that work together to enable comprehensive citation tracking, attribution, and visualization:

### 2.1 Monitoring Layer
- **Citation Logger**: Captures citation events when AI systems access scientific content
- **Event Processor**: Processes and standardizes citation events
- **Logging API**: Provides interfaces for AI systems to log citation events

### 2.2 Analysis Layer
- **SHAP Analysis**: Utilizes SHapley Additive exPlanations to quantify source contributions
- **LIME Analysis**: Employs Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations for contribution analysis
- **Attention Analysis**: Analyzes attention mechanisms in transformer models to map source importance

### 2.3 Attribution Layer
- **Citation Registry**: Central repository for all citation events
- **Knowledge Graph**: Represents relationships between entities in the citation ecosystem
- **Credit Allocator**: Distributes credit based on contribution analysis

### 2.4 Visualization Layer
- **Graph Visualizer**: Renders the knowledge graph for exploration
- **Dashboard**: Provides interactive views of citation metrics
- **API Endpoints**: Enables programmatic access to visualization data

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Citation Registry

The Citation Registry serves as the central data repository for all citation events. Each citation event includes:

```json
{
  "citation_id": "cid-12345",
  "doi": "10.1038/s41586-023-06792-0",
  "title": "Climate change impact on marine ecosystems",
  "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Johnson, T."],
  "source_type": "journal_article",
  "publication_venue": "Nature",
  "publication_date": "2023-05-15",
  "ai_model": "model-12345",
  "context": "Answering query about climate impacts on ocean ecosystems",
  "timestamp": "2023-07-22T14:25:30Z",
  "contribution_score": 0.87
}
```

### 3.2 Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph represents complex relationships between scientific entities:

- **Node Types**: Papers, Authors, Datasets, AI Models, Concepts
- **Edge Types**: Cites, Uses, Contributes_To, Builds_Upon

The graph structure enables:
- Tracking multi-step influence paths
- Identifying highly influential sources
- Analyzing network properties of the knowledge ecosystem
- Visualizing knowledge flow patterns

### 3.3 Contribution Analysis

The framework employs three complementary methods to quantify the contribution of different sources to AI outputs:

#### 3.3.1 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Based on game theory's Shapley values
- Allocates credit for predictions fairly among features
- Provides both global and local interpretability

#### 3.3.2 LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- Creates locally faithful approximations of complex models
- Explains individual predictions through surrogate models
- Works with any black-box model

#### 3.3.3 Attention Mechanism Analysis
- Utilizes attention weights from transformer models
- Maps attention to source documents
- Quantifies relative importance of different sources

### 3.4 Attribution Mechanism

The attribution mechanism follows four key principles:

1. **Proportionality**: Credit is proportional to contribution
2. **Transitivity**: Credit flows through the knowledge graph
3. **Transparency**: Attribution decisions are explainable and auditable
4. **Temporality**: Real-time attribution as knowledge is used

## 4. Implementation Approaches

### 4.1 Embedded Implementation

AI system developers can integrate the framework directly into their systems:
- Add citation hooks that trigger when sources are accessed
- Implement contribution analysis within the AI system
- Connect to the AIC-IF API for logging citation events

### 4.2 API-Based Implementation

External systems can interact with AI services through an API middleware:
- Process AI API responses
- Analyze outputs to identify likely sources
- Enrich AI responses with citation information

### 4.3 Retrospective Analysis

For existing AI systems without native support:
- Post-hoc analysis of system outputs
- Reverse engineering of knowledge sources
- Reconstruction of knowledge utilization patterns

## 5. Technical Specifications

    citation_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    doi VARCHAR(255),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    authors VARCHAR(255),
    source_type VARCHAR(50),
    publication_venue VARCHAR(255),
    publication_date DATE,
    ai_model VARCHAR(255),
